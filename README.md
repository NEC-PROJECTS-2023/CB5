INTRODUCTION

Nowadays credit card became one of the essential parts of the people. Sudden increase in E-commerce, customer started using credit card for online purchasing therefore risk of fraud also increases. Instead of carrying a huge amount in hand it is easier to keep credit cards. But nowadays that too becomes unsafe. Now a days we are facing a big problem on credit card fraud which is increasing in a good percentage. The main purpose is the survey on the various methods applied to detect credit card frauds. From the abnormalities, in the transaction, the fraudulent one is identified. We address this issue in order to implement some machine learning algorithm like Isolation Random Forest Algorithm in order to detect this kind of fraud. In this paper we increase the efficiency in finding the fraud. However, we discussed and evaluated employee criteria. Currently, the issues of credit card fraud detection have become a big problem for new researchers. We implement an intelligent algorithm which will detect all kind of fraud in a credit card transaction. We handled the problem by finding a pattern of each customer in between fraud and legal transaction. Various Machine Learning Algorithms are used to predict the pattern of transaction for each customer and a decision is made according to them. In order to prevent data from mismatching, all attribute are marked equally.
